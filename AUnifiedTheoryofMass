A Unified Theory of Mass by Phase-Aligned Interactions of Elementary Particles:
A Proposal for a New Fundamental Interaction

Physical Review Letters (2025)
Research Article

Abstract:
This study proposes a new fundamental interaction, the “phase-alignment interaction” between elementary particles, which provides a new interpretation of the nature of mass. This interaction explains the mass phenomenon through the phase alignment of the quantum states of elementary particles and opens the way to a unified understanding of the Higgs field and the gravitational field.

Main theoretical framework:

1. basic principle of the phase-aligned interaction
- Characteristics of the interaction:
  * Promotes 0 or 180 degree phase alignment between elementary particles
  * Spin-dependent interaction strength (strong for electrons, weak for photons)
  * Acts as a peer-to-peer local interaction

2. mechanism of mass manifestation
- Basic idea:
  * Mass is observed as a result of phase-aligned interactions
  * Cannot measure mass without interaction
  * Constancy of mass measurements on Earth is a composite effect of interactions from space

3. mathematical formulation

H = Σ_ij h_ij cos(φi - φj)

where:
- h_ij: interaction strength (spin-dependent)
- φi, φj: phase of particles i, j

Relation with Higgs field
- The Higgs field is interpreted as a mean field of phase-aligned interactions
- This mean field is a composite effect of interactions from all of space
- Show formal similarity to Coulomb force

Response to proposed modifications:
1. treatment of cosmological scale effects
- Addition of the proposed integral term may unnecessarily complicate the theory
- Can be adequately explained by the current synthesis of local interactions
- Consistency with Mach's principle is achieved by superposition of local interactions

2. experimental verification
The following experiments are proposed:
- Observation of phase alignment effects in electron and photon scattering experiments
- Verification of the accuracy of mass measurement in vacuum
- Quantitative measurement of spin dependence

3. new predictions
- Spin-dependent interaction due to phase-alignment effects
- Interaction strength dependence in mass measurement
- 4. influence on mass measurement in vacuum

Conclusions:
The present theory explains the masses of elementary particles from a new perspective of phase-aligned interactions and shows the potential to complement the Standard Model. It is expected that the theory will be validated through future experimental verification.
