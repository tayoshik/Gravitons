## 1. significance of entanglement entropy in QCD

Hentschinski et al. have obtained the rapidity dependence of the entanglement entropy (especially the von Neumann entropy) inside the proton based on the evolution equations of QCD (quantum chromodynamics), and have shown that it is in good agreement with experimental results for the final hadron production. in the final hadron production. Furthermore, it is suggested that this entropy behavior is strongly associated with the emergence of “non-perturbative color confinement structures” and “maximum entanglement states”.

In QCD, complex quantum correlations are generated by the interaction of gluons and quarks, and nonlocal and nonlinear behaviors (such as confinement and the Chamerson effect), which are difficult to describe only by the usual perturbative expansion, are important. Entanglement entropy is becoming a powerful tool to capture such nonperturbative and nonlocal structures, as shown by Hentschinski et al.

## 2. Correspondence with phase-aligned interactions

### 2.1 Correlation structure and entanglement brought about by phase alignment

The “phase-alignment interaction” proposed in this study is positioned as a new interaction that promotes local phase alignment (0° or 180°) via spin, which has a different fundamental principle from the conventional four interactions (electromagnetic force, strong force, weak force, and gravity). On the other hand, the increase of entanglement entropy and the appearance of maximum entangled states in QCD indicate the fact that “extensive quantum correlations” are emerging in the color charge and gluon fields.

An essential part of this “quantum correlation” may be explained in terms of phase-aligned interactions. The existence of the maximum entanglement state shown by Hentschinski et al. Hentschinski et al. suggest that some “stack of local interactions” may lead to high entanglement in the system as a whole, and that phase-aligned interactions may play a part in this mechanism.

### 2.2 QCD-like picture as a spin-dependent interaction

It is further emphasized that the phase-aligned interaction is spin-dependent. On the other hand, quark and gluon modes in QCD also have complex correlations through spin and helicity (or color degrees of freedom), and in the unperturbed regime, the linkage between the spin components often plays an essential role.  
The entropy evolution results of Hentschinski et al. show a dynamical proliferation of partons (quark gluons) evolving in the rapidity direction and the development of quantum correlations, which implies a consistent interaction of spin and color degrees of freedom behind it. This point shares the same direction as the claim of this theory that “phase alignment acts with spin-dependent intensity and influences non-perturbative coupling.”

## 3. Mass production and its relation to the Higgs field and gravity

### 3.1 New interpretation of “mass” pointed to by entanglement

The behavior of the entanglement entropy shown by Hentschinski et al. indicates that “global quantum correlations within a finite volume”, although limited to the proton interior, may determine the apparent energy distribution and effective dynamical properties of the system. In our phase-aligned model, mass is “an effect measured by the phase alignment of interactions,” and the observed mass value is determined as the sum of the phase-aligned interactions from the surrounding space, whether in vacuum or on a cosmic scale. This is also the position of how the entanglement in a QCD system looks to an “observer,” and ultimately the experimentally measured mass (or hadron energy spectrum) can be seen as a manifestation of the quantum correlations of the many-body system. 3.2 Higgs field

### 3.2 A Unified Perspective with the Higgs Field and Gravity

In this study, the Higgs field is interpreted as “the mean field of the global cosmic phase alignment. This is similar to the viewpoint of Hentschinski et al. who interpret the development of entanglement as a “superposition of local interactions,” and it is possible that the “mean field” approximation is in fact a superposition of many local phase-aligned interactions. The “mean field” approximation may in fact be a superposition of many local phase-aligned interactions.  
The entanglement studies of Hentschinski et al. If the entanglement studies of Hentschinski et al. are manifesting at the “hadronic scale”, then it is possible that gravitational phenomena can be explained by the sum of some entanglement (phase alignment) at larger scales as well.

## 4. directions for future experimental and theoretical verification

1. **Cooperation with entanglement measurements**.  
   Extending the knowledge of entanglement entropy measurements in the QCD regime (e.g., hadron spectra and detailed analysis of correlation functions) to other elementary particle regimes such as electrons and photons can verify the existence of phase-aligned interactions, as Hentschinski et al. are doing in the deep non-perturbative regime, Searching for entanglement indicators in electron and photon scattering, as Hentschinski et al. have been doing in the deep non-perturbative regime, would be a powerful tool to experimentally confirm the “spin-dependent interaction strength change” claimed in this theory.

2.**High-precision mass measurement and comparison under vacuum conditions**.  
   In order to experimentally confirm the claim that the mass measurement result depends on the interaction (phase alignment) with the quantum field in the “vacuum” state, it is essential to measure the mass with high precision in an extremely local environment. For example, one may attempt to compare mass measurements with those of ordinary ground-based experiments under microgravity conditions, such as in space or on the International Space Station.

3.**Quantitative verification of spin-dependent effects**.  
   The strength of the phase-aligned interaction is said to depend on the spin quantum number. On the other hand, in QCD entanglement studies, spin and color degrees of freedom contribute nonlinearly in various combinations. If we can accurately measure the phase-alignment efficiency depending on whether the spins are integer (boson) or 1/2 (fermion), and the behavior of the phase shift (e.g., when shifted by 180 degrees), we will have a clue to theoretically link their dependence in terms of entanglement.

## 5. Conclusion.

The evolution of entanglement entropy and the existence of “maximum entanglement states” in QCD, as shown by Hentschinski et al. (2024), provide crucial clues to understanding the non-perturbative nature of strong interactions. The results are consistent and complementary in many respects with the new interpretation of mass generation based on “phase-aligned interactions” proposed in this study.

- **Explanation of mass by phase-aligned interactions**:.  
  Mass is a measurement that arises as the sum of local phase-aligned interactions, and the underlying quantum correlations have an analogous relationship to the non-perturbative structure exhibited by the entanglement entropy of QCD.

- **Unified understanding with Higgs field/gravity**:.  
  The Higgs field is considered as a “mean field” of phase alignment, and the superposition of phase alignment effects on a cosmological scale corresponding to Mach's principle may explain gravity.

- **Future Prospects**:.  
  Experimental observations of the spin dependence, mass measurement experiments under extreme conditions, and further joint research with QCD entanglement theory are expected to verify the reality of the phase-alignment interaction and advance our understanding of the origin of particle masses.

As described above, the new developments in QCD entanglement research will not only theoretically support the mass generation framework proposed by phase-aligned interactions, but also provide important hints for extending the concept of “maximum entangled states” presented by non-perturbative quantum correlations to a wider range of particle physics and cosmology The findings of this study will be used as a basis for future research. Based on these findings, future experiments and observations may lead to an increasingly unified understanding of mass and gravity.
