## 1. QCD entanglement entropy and phase-alignment interactions

### 1.1 Key points of the entanglement study by Hentschinski et al.
- **Object**: Entanglement entropy inside the proton (specifically von Neumann entropy)  
- Method**: Calculation of the rapidity-dependent entanglement entropy using the QCD evolution equations, with comparison to hadron production data, e.g., from deep inelastic scattering (DIS).  
- **Main conclusions**:.  
  1. good agreement between experimental data and calculations, and possibility of formation of “maximum entanglement state” in the proton interior. 2.  
  2. the entanglement entropy can be an effective indicator to capture the origin of color confinement and hadron structure in the non-perturbative regime.  

The existence of this “maximum entanglement state” implies that the nonlocal quantum correlations of the strong interactions have reached an extremely high level. This may be consistent with the idea that phase-aligned interactions extend the “local and peer-to-peer alignment through degrees of freedom such as spin” as a whole, leading to cooperative alignment patterns.

### 1.2 Non-perturbative correlation formation through phase-aligned interactions
The “phase-aligned interactions” in this study are defined as those that promote the alignment of the quantum phases \(\phi_i\) and \(\phi_j\) between particles to 0 or 180 degrees via the spin-dependent coupling constant\(h_{ij}\.) The observed non-perturbative high Since the entanglement observed in QCD can be viewed as being caused by a “stack of local interactions” of gluons and quark many-body systems similar to those observed in QCD, phase-aligned interactions can be considered complementary to QCD entanglement studies in the following ways **Phase-aligned quantum correlations

- **Amplification of quantum correlations by phase alignment**.  
  Repeated accumulation of local phase-aligned interactions tends to acquire high quantum correlations (entanglement) as a whole system; the realization of maximum entangled states in QCD may also correspond to a structure in which color charges interact locally to form extensive entanglement.

- **Coupling of spin/color degrees of freedom**.  
  The work of Hentschinski et al. deals with many-body correlations of the color degrees of freedom and momentum components, but the interaction with the spin component cannot be neglected in a non-perturbative manner. We suggest that the “spin-dependent phase alignment” proposed by this theory, coupled with non-perturbative effects on the QCD side, may explain further higher-order entanglement.

## 2. New Perspectives on Mass Production and QCD Entanglement

### 2.1 Significance of mass as a “phase-aligned result
The fundamental idea of phase-aligned interactions is that mass is a quantity that can only be measured through interactions and appears as the sum of phase alignments from the entire space rather than as an absolute “attribute, Hentschinski et al.'s work highlights the fact that “observed physical quantities (e.g. hadronic mass and production cross section) are strongly influenced by the quantum correlation state of the whole system” by showing that the entanglement entropy of the proton's interior closely corresponds to the observed quantities of hadronic final states.

Since QCD entanglement is deeply related to the mass and properties of hadrons such as protons and neutrons Since QCD entanglement is closely related to the mass and properties of hadrons such as protons and neutrons, it is significant that the present study extends the mechanism of QCD entanglement to explain mass in general at the elementary particle level.

### 2.2 “Mean Field” Interpretation of the Higgs Field and Maximum Entangled States
In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is considered to be a scalar field that plays the role of giving particle mass, but in this study, the Higgs field is interpreted as “the result of the phase-aligned interaction being averaged over the entire space (mean field). This is structurally similar to the “maximum entangled state inside hadrons” pointed out by Hentschinski et al. which is the product of global quantum correlations due to a series of local interactions. Namely,

- Localized alignments and couplings arise depending on spin, chromatic degrees of freedom, etc.  
- When the stacking extends to the macroscopic and cosmic scales, the “average effect” of the interaction is observed as a field (Higgs field).  

From this viewpoint, it is possible to treat the origin of the Higgs mass as a global average of phase-aligned interactions that form a “maximum-entangled state” in a unified manner.

## 3. Prospects for experimental verification

Hentschinski et al. (2024) showed that the entanglement entropy calculated in the framework of QCD evolution is consistent with experimental data (e.g. hadron production) with high accuracy. This means that the means to directly or indirectly verify quantum correlations are now in place. The following are possible directions for experiments to confirm the existence of phase-aligned interactions in this study.

1.**Observation of phase-alignment effects in electron-photon scattering experiments**.  
   - Scattering experiments between electrons with spin 1/2 and photons with spin 1 (strictly transverse polarization mode) to verify whether the phase-alignment interaction causes the difference.  
   - Although not as non-perturbative as in the QCD regime, the subtle scattering cross section and polarization dependence may allow us to detect phase-alignment effects.

2. **Precision of mass measurement under vacuum**.  
   - According to this theory, “mass measurement cannot be defined without phase-aligned interactions.  
   - We will verify the effect of phase-aligned interactions on mass measurement by performing mass measurement in extremely low gravity and low perturbation environments (e.g., space and microgravity experimental facilities) and comparing with ground-based experiments.

3. **Quantitative measurement of spin dependence**.  
   - Although the QCD entanglement evolution of Hentschinski et al. focuses on the color degrees of freedom and momentum distribution, the connection to spin-dependent effects is also important.  
   - We will experimentally verify how the strength of the phase alignment (coupling constant\(h_{ij}\)) changes with different spins (bosons or fermions).

## 4. conclusions and future prospects

The evolution of the entanglement entropy and the existence of the maximum entangled state in QCD as shown by Hentschinski et al. (2024) means that “quantum correlations in the unperturbed regime are becoming clear to a level that can be confirmed experimentally”. And the results have affinity with the phase-aligned interaction theory of this research in the following points.

1. **The importance of non-perturbative quantum correlations**.  
   - The high entanglement exhibited by QCD is a good example of local interactions giving rise to collective and global quantum correlations.  
   - Phase-aligned interactions can also be understood as a mechanism by which spin-dependent local interactions produce global aligned structures (mass generation and Higgs field).

2.**The connection between the origin of mass and phase ordering**.  
   - The point that mass emerges as a “measured value as the sum of interactions” corresponds to the picture in which the “maximum entangled state” in QCD is directly related to the energy spectrum of hadrons and confinement phenomena.  
   - The model in which the “mean field” called Higgs field is regarded as a superposition of numerous local phase-aligned interactions is consistent with the idea of the global manifestation of entanglement.

3.**Accelerated experimental and theoretical verification**.  
   - The improved precision of the entanglement entropy measurement will enable us to further observe the spin-dependent effects predicted by the phase-aligned interactions and the mass fluctuations under vacuum conditions.  
   - In the future, comparison with the entanglement theory of QCD and demonstration of the phase-alignment effect (related to Mach's principle) on a cosmic scale are expected.

From the above, we conclude that the new interpretation of mass proposed by phase-aligned interactions is theoretically promising from the entanglement point of view and could not only complement the Standard Model but also provide a new approach to fundamental problems such as gravity and vacuum structure Hentschinski et al. QCD Entanglement studies by Hentschinski et al. will further clarify the nature of non-perturbative quantum correlations and make this theory even more convincing.
