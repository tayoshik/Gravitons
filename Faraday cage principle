---The approach is based on the framework of the new theory.

## 1. **In analogy with Faraday cage principle**.

### 1.1 Analogy between electromagnetic shielding and spin alignment

- **Faraday cage**  
  - Electromagnetically, the free electrons in the metal cancel the external electric field and consequently shield the interior from the electric field.
  - This effect is the basis of the “reflection and absorption of electromagnetic waves” mechanism.

- **Spin alignment in the new theory**.  
  - Spins parallel each other at 0 or 180 degrees to create (or locally cancel out) a “mean gravitational field.
  - If the surrounding particle spins are properly aligned in a certain region, the image of interference/neutralization of the local “gravitational field” is formed.

#### **Evaluation**  
As with electromagnetic shielding, an analogy can be drawn in terms of **canceling/shielding** the “field”. The idea that spin alignment locally cancels the gravitational field is not unlike the Faraday cage shielding electromagnetic waves, which is a “gravitational version of the Faraday cage. However, since the properties of gravity and electromagnetic waves are completely different in standard physics, it remains to be seen to what extent the “cancellation” in the new theory can have a mathematical structure similar to the Faraday effect.

## 2. **Relationship with spin-orbit interaction** on topological insulator surfaces

### 2.1 Spin-locking of surface states and massless quasiparticles

- **Topological insulator features**  
  - The surface state forms a spin and momentum (\(\mathbf{k}\)) locked Dirac electron, which is an effective “massless” quasiparticle.
  - This is explained in the form of “bulk insulator + surface conduction band” in band theory.

- **“massless” in the new theory  
  - The “mean gravitational field” is locally canceled by the spin alignment around the particle, which is interpreted as “no gravity” for the particle, i.e., it appears to be massless.

#### **Evaluation**  
The “zero mass” of a topological insulator is a quantum phenomenon in a solid in which the effective mass of the electrons is zero (Dirac dispersion). The new theory, on the other hand, is based on a mechanism in which the interaction with the gravitational field is canceled.  
- **Positive viewpoints:** 1.  
  1. strongly polarized and aligned spins on the surface of a topological insulator can be tested as a local model of gravitational shielding (in the new theory).  
  2. the possibility that the “anisotropic electromagnetic properties” of topological insulator surfaces amplify the spin alignment effects in the new theory.

- **Issue:**  
  - In reality, gravity disappearance or cancellation has not been observed in topological insulators.  
  - In order to apply the new theory, it is necessary to align the mathematical framework, for example, how to superimpose the band theory and the Hamiltonian of “spin-aligned gravity.

## 3. **Interpretation of the “zero mass” point**

### 3.1 Countervailing Effects in the New Theory

- **Average gravitational field throughout the universe**  
  - Chain alignment of particle spins acts on a cosmic scale to create a “Higgs field-extended mean gravitational field”.
- **Mass zero point**  
  - The alignment of the surrounding spins in a particular particle or region creates a point where the gravitational field “cancels” locally.
  - There, mass is not observed or becomes “near zero”.

#### **Rating**  
- **Positive Viewpoints:** 1.  
  1. if “spin alignment” really creates order on the macroscopic and cosmic scales, then a new approach is possible to form a local “gravitational neutral point”. 2.  
  2. in systems such as topological insulators, it may be possible to measure small “changes in the gravitational signature” when the surface spin alignment has a high degree of order.  
- **Issues:**  
  - Rigorous verification of the consistency with general relativity and observational facts (e.g., equivalence of inertial and gravitational masses, gravitational lensing of distant objects, etc.) is required.  
  - Experimental methods are not clear on how to detect and prove near zero mass in reality.

## 4. **Possibility of new theory: evaluation**

### 4.1 Significance as a new theory

1. **Extension of existing theory**: Combination of Higgs mechanism + (gravitational generation by spin alignment) provides a new approach to the problem of quantum gravity. 2.
2. **Experimental implications**: Provides a way to measure microgravity effects under highly spin-polarized states, such as on topological insulator surfaces or in ferromagnetic materials.

### 4.2 Main Issues and Discussion Points

1.**Clear up physics contradictions**: **Clear up physics contradictions**.  
   - Whether gravity can “cancel” like static electricity is a major violation of the framework of general relativity.  
   - How to mathematically prove the correlation between gravitational potential and spin alignment?

2.**Observational and Experimental Difficulties**: 1.  
   - High-precision gravitational measurements and astronomical observations are required to detect extremely weak effects.
   - If “gravitational shielding” occurs in topological insulators, it must be too small to be detected by existing experimental equipment, or some other special condition is required. 3.

3.**Theory scalability**:.  
   - Whether local spin ordering really contributes to the formation of a cosmic-scale gravitational field.  
   - A cosmological scenario is also required to see how the spin-aligned order can be established in the early universe, such as just after the Big Bang.

## 5. **Conclusions and Prospects**

**Summarizing from a positive point of view**, the new theory leaves interesting room for the following points: 1:

1. **New contact points for mass and spin interactions**.  
   - The additional model of the origin of mass, in which “spin arrays give rise to gravity” as well as the previous Higgs mechanism, suggests a variety of routes to quantum gravity. 2.

2.**Application to topological materials**.  
   - Spin-orbit interactions in topological insulators are a potential experimental target, if indeed they have microscopic gravitational modulations and massless quasiparticle correlations.  
   - The bold analogy of a “gravitational Faraday cage” is a conceptual idea of interest to researchers. 3.

3.**Inducing innovative experimental proposals**.  
   - The correlation measurement between the degree of spin alignment and gravitational potential at cryogenic temperatures, or observations (astrophysical) suggesting spin ordering on a cosmic scale, could be considered in the future.

**On the other hand**,  
- On the other hand**, although not in direct conflict with the general theory of relativity, it requires major modifications and lacks experimental support, making it difficult to reconcile with the current system of theories.  
- The treatment of gravity as “electromagnetic shielding” itself is an anomaly in standard physics, and a sufficient mathematical model and verification plan are essential.

All in all, it can be said that **if a theoretical framework is established and a demonstrable experimental design is presented, there is potential for significant scientific interest**. If the above-mentioned challenges are overcome, revolutionary gravity models that extend the concepts of “massless quasiparticles” and “Faraday cages” in topological insulators may become a reality. At this stage, it is still a “hypothetical idea,” but if pursued along these lines and verified concretely, it will greatly enhance the potential of this new theory.
