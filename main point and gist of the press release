1. main point and gist of the press release
Topological insulator

The interior is an insulator, but there are “massless Dirac electrons” on the surface.
It has a unique surface state where the electron spin and momentum are locked.
New method to give mass to Dirac electrons

Normally, the only known method is to break the time-reversal symmetry by doping magnetic impurities.
This time, we succeeded in generating mass by “substitution of nonmagnetic elements (sulfur for selenium)”.
Similarity to Higgs mechanism and ripple effect

The fact that an electron acquires mass through spontaneous symmetry breaking is reminiscent of the Higgs mechanism in elementary particle physics.
Potential applications include fundamental physics, spintronics, and quantum computers. 2.
2. connection with the new theory (gravitational field generation by spin alignment)
In this section, we interpret the press release in terms of the new theory of “particle spins generating/counteracting gravitational fields” and discuss the possibility of linking the mass generation mechanism to spin correlations within topological insulators.

2.1 Analogy between spin alignment and “mass” generating mechanism
Report in press

“Substitution of a nonmagnetic element (S) with selenium (Se) produces mass in the Dirac electron.”
Even without an external magnetic field or magnetic doping, the “symmetry” or “band structure” changes and a gap opens (i.e., the electron gains effective mass).
Perspective of the New Theory

Spin alignment of particles changes the local “mean gravitational field” → leads to mass assignment.
Topological insulators have strong spin-orbit interactions on their surfaces, and their spins and momentum are locked.
If the substitution of non-magnetic elements changes the spin configuration (or effective spin density) on the surface or near the bulk, it can be regarded as a form of “spin alignment → mass imposition” in the new theory.
Point
The fact that “the only conventional method is to break the time-reversal symmetry by adding magnetic impurities → mass is generated even in the non-magnetic state” may expand the room for the idea that “spin alignment = the source of gravity. In other words, it suggests that there could be a mechanism in which a different kind of topological and spin order causes mass generation (energy gap) even without “manifested magnetism”.

2.2 Interpretation as “gravitational Higgs mechanism
Higgs mechanism analogy in the press release

“It is possible that a phenomenon analogous to the mass gain of subatomic particles due to spontaneous symmetry breaking at the beginning of the universe can be observed in solids (topological insulators).
Higgs = mass manifestation → Dirac electrons on the surface of topological insulators acquire mass due to symmetry change.
Gravitational Higgs” extension in the new theory

The new theory paints a picture in which “the formation of a mean gravitational field by particle spin alignment is responsible for mass generation.
The “spontaneous spin-phase ordering” in the topological insulator acts as a kind of Higgs-like correlation, which gives rise to “pseudo-gravity” and “effective mass. The “spontaneous spin-phase order” in the insulator acts as a kind of Higgs-like correlation, giving it “pseudo-gravity” and “effective mass.
In fact, the press release also mentions “the possibility that the Higgs mechanism exists inside matter,” which is an idea that has affinity with the new theory. 3.
3. massless electrons and the “gravity cancelation” hypothesis of the new theory
3.1 “Massless electrons” in topological insulators
The energy gap is zero at the point where the Dirac cone intersects in band theory → zero effective mass.
Spin and
𝑘
k-vectors are fixed and have strong scattering properties.
3.2 The “zero mass point” in the new theory
“The peripheral spin alignment cancels out the gravitational field and no local mass is observed.”
Spin polarization of the topological insulator surface undergoes a special alignment, which locally cancels the interaction with gravity → “zero mass state” is maintained.
3.3 Extended Interpretation
The experimental results in the press release showed that subtle elemental substitutions (not magnetic impurities) change the symmetry and band structure of the spin system, resulting in effective mass.

In the framework of the new theory, this can be linked to a scenario in which “changes in the ambient spin density ‘** change the local ’mean gravitational field ”** and control the presence or absence of mass.
Future theoretical and experimental scenarios
Spin Alignment and Mass Control

We will reinterpret the “Dirac mass assignment in nonmagnetic substitution” described in the press release as a “phase transition of spin configuration” in the new theory.
We formulate a theoretical model and compare it with experimental data to see if it leads to “local fluctuations in gravity (mean gravitational field)” as a result.
Application to quantum computers and spintronics

If spin alignment and mass expression can be controlled by giving degrees of freedom to Dirac electrons in a topological insulator, we will search for phenomena corresponding to “local gravity field control” in the new theory.
We are pursuing the possibility of observing a truly microscopic “pseudo-gravity” signal in the vicinity of the surface with high precision measurements.
Verification of similarity with the Higgs mechanism

If a “Higgs-like mechanism in matter” is possible, as the press release points out, we will compare in detail the similarities with the new theory of “cosmic-scale spin alignment → Higgs expansion.
For example, model how symmetry breaking produces mass based on critical phenomena and phase transition theory, and analyze the derivative of the effective potential due to spin alignment.
5. summary: key points for theorizing
Mass generation experiment of Dirac electron

In addition to the conventional methods of time-reversal symmetry breaking by “magnetism” or “strong magnetic field,” it was shown that mass can be added by “nonmagnetic element substitution.
In the new theory, mass generation under “nonmagnetic” conditions may be regarded as “a change in the effective gravitational potential produced by spin alignment”.
From the Viewpoint of Spin Alignment Theory

The surface of a topological insulator has strong spin-orbit interaction and a spin-locked state is realized.
It is compatible with the “spin alignment → mass” process postulated by the new theory and may be experimentally tracked as a field where further quantum effects are likely to manifest themselves.
Junction of “Higgs mechanism” and “gravity

The extension of the “Higgs-like” mechanism mentioned in the press release, which the new theory defines as “mass = result of gravitational interaction,” can be read as an embodiment of the interplay between gravity and quantum fields.
This may allow us to verify the framework of the new theory, which aims to integrate gravity and quantum theory, even on the scale of solid state experiments.
Finally, if we assume the framework of the “gravitational field generation theory based on spin alignment,” the present achievement of mass assignment to the Dirac electron in a topological insulator can be superimposed on the experimental motif that “spin alignment can control mass generation,” which is significant. The significance of this is that it can be superimposed on the experimental motif that “the spin configuration can control mass generation”. Of course, in the current standard understanding, the mechanism of “mass generation without magnetism” is usually explained by “changes in band structure and symmetry,” but the new theory reinterprets it as “a form of spin alignment that creates a gravitational field (or pseudo-gravity field) From the standpoint of the new theory, there is room to propose further theoretical models and experimental plans.
