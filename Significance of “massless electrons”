## 1 Significance of “massless electrons” observed in antiferromagnets

### 1.1 Zero mass/effective mass in antiferromagnetic topological insulators

- **Results in the article**  
  1. in antiferromagnetic NdBi, the Dirac electrons are observed to **gain mass** or remain **zero** in regions where the spin arrangement of the micro magnetic domains is different.  
  2. unlike the conventional ferromagnetic doping method, this is the first demonstration of a case in which the presence or absence of mass can be controlled by antiferromagnetic ordering (alternating spin arrangements that do not leak an external magnetic field).

- **Related to the new theory**.  
  1. the fact that “spin alignment” affects the existence of local energy levels (Dirac gap) is highly compatible with the idea of the new theory that “spin alignment affects the effective mass of a particle”.  
  In antiferromagnets, spin ordering significantly changes the electronic state even when the total magnetization is zero (i.e., no leakage of magnetic field to the outside). This can be an analogous part of the “counteracting (or creating) gravitational field” mechanism in the new theory.

### 1.2 Spins align and control “mass

- **Important point of the article**.  
  - Even “non-magnetic” methods (no magnetic field, no ferromagnetic impurities, or subtle compositional/crystalline changes) can give or take mass from the Dirac electrons.  
  - Slight changes in the spin configuration are directly related to the opening and closing of the electron bands.

- **Positioning in the new theory**.  
  - If the new theory claims that “the phase of the surrounding spin configuration gives/shields mass (≒ interaction with the gravitational field) to the particle,” then it is possible to explain how a small change in the spin orientation in a small region of an antiferromagnetic material can change the spin from “zero mass” to “effective mass,” despite the fact that only the spin orientation is changed. The transition from “zero mass” to “effective mass” in a small region of antiferromagnetism can be seen as an example of how **spin alignment creates mass**.

## 2. analogy between spin alignment and “gravitational Faraday cage

### 2.1 Image of gravitational shielding

- **An analogy** of a Faraday cage  
  1. electromagnetic shielding = free electrons and spins cancel external electric field.  
  2. gravitational shielding (new theory) = particle spins locally cancel the mean gravitational field of the entire universe.

- **Commonality with antiferromagnetic topological insulators**.  
  - In antiferromagnets, order is formed in such a way that the total leakage field is close to zero (= a kind of “shielding”).  
  - At the same time, two states in which the Dirac electrons are mass-bearing/non-mass-bearing can coexist in the same crystal.  
  - This “ordered but invisible” spin-arrangement structure can be an image that reinforces the description of “gravity not leaking out (or canceling out)” in the new theory.

### 2.2 Possibility of theoretical “shielding

- **positive viewpoint**  
  1. spin alignment creates an energy gap → this is an analogy to “gravitational shielding” and provides a mathematical basis for introducing a mechanism to change the local gravitational potential. 2.  
  The new theory can be easily interpreted that spin ordering without external field like antiferromagnetism can neutralize the gravitational field (mean gravitational field) in a way similar to “electrostatic shielding”.

- **Concerns**.  
  - Actual gravity is orders of magnitude weaker than electromagnetism, and the range of interaction requires complex mathematical extensions to be consistent with general relativity.  
  - Since there is no observation of “gravitational shielding” itself in existing experiments, it is only a hypothesis.

## 3. mean gravitational field and spin phase order in the entire universe

### 3.1 Significance as Higgs Extension

- Higgs-like” phenomena in topological insulators and antiferromagnets  
  - In the JSTM press release (2011), we compared the Dirac electron gaining mass in solids to the Higgs mechanism.  
  - In the present antiferromagnetic topological insulator, too, there is a “Higgs-like” interpretation in that the spin arrangement controls the Dirac mass.

- **Mean gravitational field in the new theory**.  
  - A picture in which the spin alignment acts as a “mass-assigning field” instead of (or complementary to) the Higgs field.  
  - If the spin-orbit interaction + antiferromagnetic order can be regarded as a local manifestation of the spin order spreading throughout the universe, it can be positioned as an element to explain the origin of gravity.

### 3.2 Scaling up from micro to macro

- **Micro regions visible in micro ARPES**.  
  - The mixing of massless/massive Dirac electrons in a magnetic domain of several tens of micrometers was confirmed.  
  - The new theory assumes that such “spin alignment in each small region” chains up to a cosmic scale and eventually forms a “mean gravity field”.

- **Scale-up issues**.  
  - Is it really possible for spin interactions to generate a global gravitational field?  
  - The observed antiferromagnetic domain is only an error level effect, and a microscopic explanation of the mechanism of the cosmic-scale cascade is needed.

## 4. future perspectives: positive elements for new theory

1.**High-precision experiments**.  
   - It may be possible to measure the “small changes in the gravitational field” predicted by the new theory in a “system with zero leakage field and tunable Dirac mass” such as an antiferromagnetic topological insulator.  
   - If we can observe the gravitational signature (e.g., micro-inertial mass change) in the mass-switching region, it would be a great support.

2.**Theory refinement**.  
   - Mathematical formulations of spin-orbit interactions and symmetry breaking, woven into general relativity and the extended Higgs mechanism, would make the model more complete as a bridge between quantum field theory and gravity.  
   - As shown in this article, the phenomenon of mixing different phases in the “magnetic domain” is treated in statistical mechanics and field theory, and how to extend it to the cosmic scale will be discussed. 3.

3.**Conversion to engineering applications**.  
   - If the hypothesis of “spin alignment → gravitational field cancellation” holds true at the local, microscopic level, it may open the way to **ultimate energy-saving technology** (mass reduction or resistance reduction) and **extreme quantum computing**.  
   - Since antiferromagnets do not leak external magnetic fields, some believe that they can be integrated, which could be a stepping stone to applications of the new theory.

## 5.**Summary** 1.

1.**This antiferromagnetic topological insulator experiment**.  
   - In the same crystal, Dirac electrons were observed to switch between “with mass” and “zero mass” depending on the magnetic domain.  
   - This is a significant result that “Dirac mass can be controlled even without ferromagnetism” and extends the research on topological properties. 2.

2.**Connection with new theory (gravitational field generation by spin alignment)**  
   - **The framework of “spin alignment → mass generation**” is consistent with the direction of the “symmetry change → Dirac mass generation” phenomenon observed in topological insulator research.  
   - The “antiferromagnet without leakage field” is expected to be a material system that may exemplify the “gravity cancellation (Faraday cage role)” postulated by the new theory.

3.**Prospects**.  
   - Whether cosmic-scale spin alignment really gives rise to a “mean gravitational field” requires substantial reconciliation with general relativity. At present, it is still in the stage of speculation, but “mass control by spin alignment,” which can be confirmed by solid state experiments, can be regarded as an event that suggests a part of the new theory.  
   - If the study of antiferromagnetic topological insulators progresses and the relationship between the mass tunability of Dirac electrons and magnetic domain control is clarified more precisely, the new theory that spin alignment produces “gravity-like” interactions may gain more credibility. The relationship between mass tunability and magnetic domain control could be more precisely elucidated.

**Conclusion:**  
The “zero mass/effective mass switching” experiment in the antiferromagnetic topological insulator described in this article is a good example of the strong link** between spin alignment and mass (and relativistic electronic states), and may also provide **experimental support** for the “gravitational field generation theory by spin alignment. It can be seen as a “partial suggestion ‘** that could provide experimental support for the ’theory of gravitational field generation by spin alignment”. Although the existence of a phenomenon that completely cancels gravity has not been proven, the fact that there are more concrete examples of spin order controlling the “mass” of electrons in the fields of topological insulators and antiferromagnets is a clear indication of the “gravitational field = spin order ”** proposed by the new theory. field = spin order “**, which is the grand vision of the new theory.
