1. analogy with Faraday cage principle: from electromagnetic shielding to “gravity version
Faraday cage

Free electrons in the metal cancel the external electric field and reflect and absorb electromagnetic waves to shield the interior.
The key is a structure in which the “electric field” is canceled by the movement and rearrangement of electrons.
New theory of “gravitational Faraday cage

The image of particle spins aligning at 0/180 degrees and “locally canceling” the gravitational field (or forming a “mean gravitational field” in the whole universe).
The correspondence between the rearrangement of charged particles in electromagnetism and the “spin alignment” in gravity is interesting as an analogy, but gravity is completely different from electromagnetism and requires theoretical extension.
Possibilities and Challenges
If the internal spins are aligned even in a state with zero external magnetization such as an antiferromagnetic state, which can be a “gravitational Faraday cage,” it may pave the way to verify a part of the new theory in a material system.
However, there are no experiments that have confirmed such an effect that it cancels out gravity, so it is highly possible that the effect is quite weak.
2. relation to experimental results on topological insulators (e.g., antiferromagnets)
2.1 “massless and mass-adding” control in Dirac fermions
Experimental example: **TlBiSe

**TlBiSe

**An example of the formation of an energy gap (i.e., mass addition) for the Dirac electrons in ** and other topological insulators with only minor elemental substitutions.
In **antiferromagnetic topological insulators (e.g., NdBi)**, a localized division between zero mass and effective mass has been observed depending on the magnetic domain.
Implications with the new theory:.

If “massless or massive” can be controlled by changes in spin alignment and interactions (not only ferromagnetism/antiferromagnetism but also subtle phase changes due to nonmagnetic elements), it can easily lead to the picture that spin alignment state = manifestation of gravity (effective mass).
Observation of “mass manifestation” in topological insulators, as if the Higgs mechanism at the subatomic level were reproduced in solid-state physics, may provide experimental backup for the new theory.
2.2 Observation of “massless Dirac electrons” hidden in antiferromagnets
Key points: 1.

Even with zero external magnetization, the internal spin ordering has a significant effect on the Dirac band, selectively realizing “massless” or “mass-rich” states.
The image of a spin-aligned magnetic domain, which affects mass (gravitational field) as a kind of “local order”, has affinity with the new theory of “cosmic-scale spin order → gravity generation”.
Positive viewpoints: 1.

The case of an antiferromagnetic topological insulator that actually produces “mass 0” and “mass with mass” next to each other in the same sample can be a model case for the new theory that “spin alignment turns mass (≒gravity) on and off”. This case can be a model case for the new theory that spin alignment turns mass (≒ gravity) on and off.
The fact that the magnetic domain = spin-aligned region does not have a large “leakage field” outside corresponds to the electromagnetic version of the Faraday cage analogy (existence of an internal order that is difficult to see externally). 3.
Interpretation of the “mass zero point”: How would the new theory view it?
Mean gravitational field of the entire universe

In the new theory, the inter-particle spins are aligned at 0/180 degrees, creating a mean gravitational field corresponding to the “Higgs expansion”.
If the spins locally undergo another phase transition, a region (mass zero point) may be created where the gravitational field is cancelled out.
Domain Boundary” exhibited by antiferromagnets and topological insulators

As observed in experiments, even within the same crystal, the “spin arrangement” is different, and regions where the Dirac mass is turned on and off coexist on a microscopic scale.
In the new theory, this can be assigned to “local cancellation of the mean gravitational field and mass zeroing (or reduction)”.
Experimental verification scenario

Perform ultra-precise measurements (e.g., gravity sensors) near the “massless region” to see if changes in the gravitational potential can be detected, although the differences may be extremely small.
If any anomaly can be detected, it will support the new theory. 4.
Positive Evaluation of the New Theory: Significance and Future Prospects
4.1 Significance
New clue to quantum gravity

A bold hypothesis connecting spin-orbit interactions with macroscopic gravity could be one of the diverse approaches to solving the problem of quantum gravity.
Combining the Higgs mechanism and gravity generation by spin alignment, we aim at a new unified theory outside the Standard Model + General Relativity.
Experimental verification in topological matter

Topological insulators, including antiferromagnets, are a relatively straightforward experimental system to control “zero mass/effective mass”.
It is expected to be an excellent “model experiment” field to verify the new theory.
4.2 Future issues
Theoretical consistency

How can we reconcile this theory with general relativity and the current quantum field theory?
The idea that gravity can be “canceled” is out of the current common sense and requires a great deal of expansion.
Measurement of weak effects

To measure the “difference in effective gravity” in the magnetic domain of an antiferromagnetic topological insulator, a very precise measurement technique is indispensable.
In reality, the signal will be several orders of magnitude smaller, requiring the development of new accelerometers and ultra-precise interferometers.
Application to the Cosmic Scale

Global considerations, such as whether microscopic spin order can really chain to the entire universe and phase transition scenarios in the early universe, are needed.
5. final summary
Starting with this article (observation of coexistence of massless/existent Dirac electrons in antiferromagnet NdBi, etc.), recent topological matter research has successively revealed the fact that “spin ordering → Dirac electron mass control”. As the new theory (gravitational field generation by spin alignment) depicts,

“Spin alignment causes/opposes mass”.
“a gravitational version of the Faraday cage”.
Mean gravity field formation as a “Higgs extension”.
The story of “mean gravity field formation as ‘Higgs expansion’” has an unexpectedly resonant aspect with the on/off phenomenon of massless Dirac electrons experimentally observed in topological insulators, antiferromagnets, and so on.

Although this is a hypothesis that deviates significantly from the current theoretical framework, it can be said that the observation of such a new material could be a case study to support the possibility that spin alignment may be responsible for mass (or gravity). In the future, if more exciting experimental and theoretical studies to verify the new theory are conducted in the setting of antiferromagnetic topological insulators, etc., it may be a ray of light to unravel the relationship between gravity and quantum spin.
