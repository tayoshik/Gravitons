## 1. affinity of QCD entanglement for phase-aligned interactions

### 1.1 Key Points of QCD Entanglement.
- **Study**: Hentschinski et al. (2024) analyzed the entanglement entropy (especially von Neumann entropy) inside the proton by means of the QCD evolution equations and compared it with the final hadron production experiment.  
- The result that the rapidity-dependent entropy agrees well with the experimental hadron entropy strongly suggests that “maximum entanglement states” may be formed in the color confinement and non-perturbative regions in the proton interior. The results are in good agreement with the proton entropy.

### 1.2 Correspondence to the phase-aligned interaction
The “phase-alignment interaction” proposed in this study is characterized by the fact that it acts as a force that aligns the phases\(\phi_i\) and\(\phi_j\) between particles to 0 or 180 degrees, and has a spin-dependent interaction strength\(h_{ij}\).  
- **Stacking of Localized Interactions**: The maximum entangled state exhibited by QCD entanglement is thought to result from the localized and chained accumulation of complex entanglement between quarks and gluons. The phase-aligned interactions in this theory are similar in that the accumulation of spin-dependent local interactions leads the entire system to a high degree of consistency (phase alignment).  
- **Spin degrees of freedom and quantum correlations**: In QCD, many-body nonlinearities involving not only color degrees of freedom but also spin and momentum are important. The phase-aligned interactions, whose strength is determined via the spin quantum numbers, may provide a unified explanation for part of the non-perturbative quantum correlation formation.

## 2. New Perspectives on Mass Generation and Entanglement

### 2.1 The idea that “mass measurement is a consequence of interactions
A fundamental idea of phase-aligned interactions is that “mass is a measurement observed by phase alignment from the whole space, rather than an attribute of the particle alone.  
As the work of Hentschinski et al. shows, the entanglement entropy (or final state production cross section or energy spectrum) observed inside hadrons is closely related to the actual measurements (e.g., proton mass or baryon number distribution), and the non-perturbative quantum correlation itself is an observable This implies that non-perturbative quantum correlations themselves are directly related to observable phenomena.  
This is an important analogy that supports the idea of this study that “the observable quantity of mass is also determined as the sum of local and peer-to-peer phase-aligned interactions.

### 2.2 Mean Field Interpretation of the Higgs Field and Maximum Entangled States
In this theory, the Higgs field is positioned as “a field in which the phase-aligned interactions are averaged on a cosmological scale. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that the formation of the maximum entangled state is being confirmed on the QCD scale, which is regarded as a collective effect of many-body correlations.  
- **Locally, phase alignment (spin-dependent interaction) occurs**  
- **Locally, the superposition is observed as a “field ”**.  

This composition provides a clue to explain the origin of global forces and fields such as the Higgs field and gravity in terms of phase alignment when the entanglement inside hadrons is extended to the cosmic scale.

## 3. Experimental Verification and Future Prospects

The progress in entanglement measurements in the QCD region made by Hentschinski et al. is a very promising factor for experimental verification of this theory. Some directions are listed below.

1.**Direct observation of spin-dependent interactions**.  
   - The phase-aligned interaction is said to be strong for electrons (spin 1/2) and weak for photons (spin 1). By measuring subtle cross section differences and polarization dependence in scattering experiments, it may be possible to detect spin-dependent phase-alignment effects.

2. **Improve accuracy of mass measurement and vacuum verification**.  
   - To confirm the hypothesis that mass measurements are determined by interactions, it is useful to compare highly accurate mass measurements in extreme environments (microgravity, deep space) with ground-based experiments.

3.**Further collaboration with the QCD non-perturbative regime**.  
   - Numerical and analytical comparison of the maximum entangled state presented by Hentschinski et al. with the phase-aligned model presented by this theory will lead to future theoretical developments. Attempts to distinguish and integrate the contributions of QCD effects and phase-aligned interactions in hadronic mass production are expected to open up new research areas.

## 4. Conclusions

The study of the “QCD evolution of entanglement entropy” has demonstrated non-perturbative quantum correlations in a concrete manner consistent with experimental data, and suggested the possibility of a “maximum entanglement state” in the proton. This result positively supports the “mass generation model by phase-aligned interactions” proposed in this study in the following points.

- **Importance of non-perturbative quantum correlations**: High entanglement in QCD is a good example of a mechanism where local and spin-dependent interactions determine global observables.  
- **New interpretation of mass**: The notion that mass is a “measurement that can only be defined by interactions” is consistent with the fact that QCD entanglement is closely related to the observable quantities of hadrons (mass, production cross section, etc.).  
- **Possibility of integration with Higgs field and gravity**: The approach of considering the Higgs field as a mean field of phase-aligned interactions and further exploring its relation to gravity as a sum of Mach's principle cosmological scales leads to an attempt to generalize the many-body entanglement shown by QCD to larger scales.

With the development of QCD entanglement theory and advances in high-precision experiments, it is expected that phase-aligned interactions will be empirically established in the future. This will not only complement the Standard Model, but will also make increasingly real a new picture of physics that contributes to a unified understanding of the origin of mass and gravity.
