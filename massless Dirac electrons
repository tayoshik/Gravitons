1. discovery of massless Dirac electrons in antiferromagnetic topological insulators
1.1 Summary of Research Results
Observed facts
On the surface of an antiferromagnet called NdBi, there is a mixture of domains in which massless Dirac electrons exist and domains of mass-assigned Dirac electrons.
Generally, in conventional topological insulators, the massless Dirac electrons are stable under nonmagnetic conditions, and mass is created (gap opening) when ferromagnetism or magnetic impurity doping is used.
In this study, we have confirmed for the first time in the world that a spin-ordered state called “antiferromagnetism” without an external leakage field controls the existence of the mass (effective mass) of the Dirac electron by space-resolved observation (micro ARPES).
1.2 Relation to the new theory
Spin ordering and mass manifestation
According to the new theory, “spin alignment is closely related to the onset of gravity (or effective mass).
The results of this study suggest that even spin ordering that does not exhibit external magnetization, as in antiferromagnets, has a mechanism for generating electron mass.
This can be easily connected with the viewpoint of the new theory that “spin order itself can contribute to mass generation even if it is not magnetic.
2. concept of the new theory: spin ordering and gravity (mass)
2.1 Analogy with “gravity” version of Faraday cage
Point: In a Faraday cage, the electromagnetic field is canceled by the movement of free electrons.
Analogy: Even in antiferromagnets, the spins are alternately aligned and achieve internal order in a way that does not leak the magnetic field to the outside.
Interpretation of the new theory: The spins are aligned at 0 or 180 degrees.
The force of the spins aligning at 0 or 180 degrees results in the formation/cancellation of a “mean gravitational field”.
Since mass is caused by the effect of spin alignment (corresponding to the Higgs mechanism), mass appears on “planes where the spins are aligned in unison” and disappears on “alternately aligned planes,” etc.
2.2 Mapping to “massless/massive” Dirac electrons in antiferromagnets
Observation: “massless/massless” Dirac electrons in different magnetic domains on the same NdBi crystal surface.
Possible new theory:.
Massive” region → Spin alignment acts to contribute to ‘gravity generation’ and effective mass is assigned.
Massless” regime → spin alignment ‘cancels gravity’ and Dirac fermions remain massless (do not interact with gravity). 3.
3. Higgs mechanism and an extended interpretation of the “mean gravitational field of the entire universe
3.1 Spin alignment to the cosmic scale
Implications of the article: 1.

Mass generation similar to the Higgs mechanism can occur in solids.
The analogy between the “mass on/off” switching of the Dirac electron in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator and the mass generation of elementary particles (Higgs mechanism) is a theme mentioned in the JST press release.
The “mean gravitational field of the entire universe” in the new theory

Phase-matching interactions of particle spins are assumed to be chained on a cosmic scale.
The “order that does not manifest itself externally,” as seen in antiferromagnetic topological insulators, may actually spread macroscopically and control gravity.
3.2 Extended Higgs: Integration of spin interaction and gravity
Positive viewpoint
As shown in the experimental results of antiferromagnets, the situation in which mass is or is not attached to the Dirac electrons due to differences in the magnetic domain may be interpreted as a local change in the “phase” of the Higgs field.
If we introduce the “spin alignment = gravitational field generation” that the new theory describes, it may be one of the new clues to unify the Higgs field and gravity. 4.
4. future experimental and theoretical developments
4.1 Verification of Microgravity Effects
for antiferromagnetic topological insulators.
Can we use ultra-precise accelerometers or interferometers to measure whether the “microgravity potential” appears different in regions where mass is added in spite of nonmagnetism, and in regions where the mass remains zero?
If such experiments confirm the difference, we will be close to proving the new theory of “local change of gravity due to spin alignment”.
4.2 Scale-up and application to cosmology
Theoretical Aspects
We will develop a mathematical model of an extended scenario in which an antiferromagnetic-like “spin alignment” was universally established in the universe immediately after the Big Bang, and it supports today's mean gravitational field (or cosmological constant).
A gauge-theoretic framework integrating spin-orbit interactions and gravity is constructed in conjunction with topological phases.
4.3 Applied physical properties research
Energy-saving devices/quantum devices
We will realize low-power devices by utilizing “Dirac electrons with switchable effective masses,” even if they cannot “cancel out gravity.
If the “gravitational” effect can be controlled to a small degree, it could be applied to new types of sensors and quantum computing platforms.
Summary: Key Points Supporting the New Theory
Discovery of antiferromagnetic topological insulators

The coexistence of “effective mass” and “massless” Dirac electrons in each magnetic domain could be a major hint for the new theory that spin alignment determines mass.
The fact that mass can be controlled in an environment with no external magnetic field and near-zero magnetization is easily compatible with a “Faraday cage”-like framework that does not leak gravity to the outside world.
Extended Concept of Higgs Mechanism

The “symmetry change → Dirac mass generation” shown by the experimental results is reminiscent of the Higgs mechanism.
The new theory could interpret this as a form of “gravitational field generation by spin alignment.
Future Challenges

The key is to overcome the physical contradictions (compatibility with general relativity, possibility of canceling gravity, etc.) and to experimentally detect fine gravity modulation.
How a cosmological extension scenario of spin alignment can be constructed is also an important theoretical issue.
In conclusion, the results of this study (selective appearance of “massless/massive” Dirac electrons in antiferromagnets) may provide fundamental support or analogous material for the new theory that spin alignment is deeply involved in mass generation**. Although the new theory does not show complete shielding or cancellation of the gravitational field at this point, it does show that spin ordering in matter can manipulate the mass state of electrons at will, and this is a fundamental support or analogy for the ideas of “Faraday cage for gravity” and “mean field There is a great potential to connect with the ideas of “Faraday cage of gravity” and “mean gravitational field” that the new theory describes.
